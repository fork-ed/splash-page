                Don't reinvent the wheel
                Fork it!
            </h2>
            <p>
                There's so many online courses and tutorials that teach what you want to teach already,
                but they're sometimes not quite right for the job.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't reinvent the wheel by starting from scratch.
                Simply take the course and fork it!
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you've forked a course you can edit its content and structure as if it were your own.
                Forking allows you to improve a course and make it fit your own needs.

                Social Course Creation
                Fork, Improve, Give back
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you've forked a course and made some improvements don't just keep it to yourself.
                Give back!
            </p>
            <p>
                ForkEd allows you to ask the original course creator to merge your improvements into your course.
                This makes curriculum creation truly social as good ideas fork and merge with zero friction.

                Personalised learning
            </h2>
            <p>
                Forking isn't just for educators.
                As a student you can fork a course and personalise it to suit your own goals and learning styles.
            </p>
            <p>
                This means that as an educator you can create a course for each of your students by just creating one course.
